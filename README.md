Don't you ever just wish these mods could **shut up?**
Now you can make them. Shut Up! blocks all messages within the first five seconds of joining a world, with the exception of chat messages by real people. Hit a keybind while loading your world to see them. This mod is clientside only, so you can use it on servers as well. Requires Fabric API.
